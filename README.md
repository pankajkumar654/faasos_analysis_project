Challenges and Solutions:
Issue: Dealing with Blank Rows in the Dataset
When I first got the dataset, there was a tricky problem â€“ some rows in certain columns were completely empty. This caused confusion when I tried to filter the data using the WHERE clause with methods like IN or =. Those empty rows messed up my results, making things not quite right.

Solution: Fixing Null Values with COALESCE
To solve this, I used a handy function called COALESCE in my queries. COALESCE is like a backup plan for null values. It lets you replace null values with a specific default value. In my case, I used COALESCE to replace the blank spots with something sensible, making sure my queries gave me reliable and accurate results. This simple trick sorted out the unexpected issues caused by those empty rows in the dataset.
